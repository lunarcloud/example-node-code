## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK][dotnet-download] 10.0
- Git
- A code editor (Visual Studio, VS Code, or Rider recommended)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lunarcloud/example-node-code.git
   cd example-node-code
   ```

2. Restore dependencies:

   ```bash
   dotnet tool restore
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   dotnet build --configuration Release
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/AvaloniaNodeEditor/AvaloniaNodeEditor.csproj
   ```

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Follow the [C# Coding Conventions][csharp-conventions]
- Use clear, descriptive names for variables, methods, and classes
- Write XML documentation comments for all public, internal, and private members
- Keep methods focused and single-purpose
- Write tests for new functionality

### Code Style

This project enforces code style through `.editorconfig`. Key requirements:

- **Indentation**: 4 spaces for C#, 2 spaces for YAML/JSON/XML
- **Line Endings**: LF (Unix-style)
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 with BOM
- **Namespaces**: Use file-scoped namespace declarations
- **Braces**: Required for all control statements
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Interfaces: `IInterfaceName`
  - Classes/Structs/Enums: `PascalCase`
  - Methods/Properties: `PascalCase`
  - Parameters/Local Variables: `camelCase`

### XML Documentation

All members require XML documentation with proper indentation:

```csharp
/// <summary>
///     Brief description of what this does.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="parameter">Description of the parameter.</param>
/// <returns>Description of the return value.</returns>
public int ExampleMethod(string parameter)
{
    // Implementation
}
```

Note the spaces after `///` for proper indentation in summary blocks.

## Testing Guidelines

### Future Testing

This project currently does not have automated tests but should follow these guidelines when tests are added:

- Use modern testing frameworks (xUnit or MSTest v4)
- Write tests that are clear and focused
- Consider UI testing frameworks like Avalonia.Headless for UI tests
- Link tests to requirements in `requirements.yaml` when applicable

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test --configuration Release

# Run specific test
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~YourTestName"

# Run with coverage
dotnet test --collect "XPlat Code Coverage"
```

## Documentation

### Markdown Guidelines

All markdown files must follow these rules (enforced by markdownlint):

- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Use ATX-style headers (`# Header`)
- Lists must be surrounded by blank lines
- Use reference-style links: `[text][ref]` with `[ref]: url` at document end
- **Exception**: `README.md` uses absolute URLs (it's included in the NuGet package)

### Spell Checking

All files are spell-checked using cspell. Add project-specific terms to `.cspell.json`:

```json
{
  "words": [
    "myterm"
  ]
}
```

## Quality Checks

Before submitting a pull request, ensure all quality checks pass:

### 1. Build

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Build must succeed with zero warnings.

### 2. Linting

```bash
# These commands run in CI - verify locally if tools are installed
markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"
cspell "**/*.{md,cs}"
yamllint -c .yamllint.yaml .
```

### 3. Code Quality

Maintain high code quality standards. Code should follow the project's style guidelines and pass all static analysis checks.

## Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests when applicable

Examples:

- `Add support for custom report headers`
- `Fix crash when SARIF file path is invalid`
- `Update documentation for --report-depth option`
- `Refactor argument parsing for better testability`

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update Documentation**: Update relevant documentation for your changes
2. **Run Quality Checks**: Ensure all linters and builds pass
3. **Submit PR**: Create a pull request with a clear description
4. **Code Review**: Address feedback from maintainers
5. **Merge**: Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

### Pull Request Template

When creating a pull request, include:

- **Description**: What changes does this PR introduce?
- **Motivation**: Why are these changes needed?
- **Related Issues**: Link to any related issues
- **Testing**: How have you tested these changes?
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] Documentation updated
  - [ ] Build passes
  - [ ] Code follows style guidelines

## Requirements Management

Avalonia Node Editor uses [DemaConsulting.ReqStream][reqstream] for requirements traceability:

- All requirements are defined in `requirements.yaml`
- Each requirement should be linked to test cases
- Run `dotnet reqstream` to generate requirements documentation
- Use the `--enforce` flag to ensure all requirements have test coverage

## Release Process

Releases are managed by project maintainers. The process includes:

1. Version bump in project files
2. Tag the release in Git
3. Build and test across all supported platforms
4. Create GitHub release with artifacts and release notes
